# vui-custom-values-with-synonyms
This project provides npm package to add custom "slot" (i.e. VUI type) with synonym functionality to any js object.
Once this functionality is added then the custom slots and their associated values can be added.
Then you can generate custom slot values directly from code for import into Amazon Alexa console, for example.
Furthermore, the use of these values is further improved because mapping functions between equivalent custom slot values are automatically generated and added to the object.
While the primary purpose is to add this functionality to other VUI related objects, this is NOT necessary and is purely driven by usefullness.
These functions can be added to ANY object and they don't require that the target class has anything to do with VUI.
